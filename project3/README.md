# Programming Project 3: Threaded Mandelbrot set generator
Goals of the project:
- To learn how to exploit fine-grained parallelism with threads.
- To identify and protect critical sections in concurrent programs.
- To recognize and solve load imbalance problems.
- To have a little fun with the Mandelbrot set.

# Preparation
- Make sure all the needed libraries exist in your environment.
- The way the Makefile is structured, all you have to do is change the name of the document you want to run in the SOURCE variable

# Switch Statement
- Use the _ character to _:
    - 'q' 
        - exit
    - 'mouse click' 
        - recenter the screen
    - 'i' 
        - zoom in
    - 'o' 
        - zoom out
    - 'r' 
        - move right
    - 'l' 
        - move left
    - 'u' 
        - move up 
    - 'd' 
        - move down
    - '-' 
        - decrease maxiter
    - '+' 
        - increase maxiter
    - '1' 
        - to run 1 thread
    - '2' 
        - to run 2 threads
    - '3' 
        - to run 3 threads
    - '4' 
        - to run 4 threads
    - '5' 
        - to run 5 threads
    - '6' 
        - to run 6 threads
    - '7' 
        - to run 7 threads
    - '8' 
        - to run 8 threads
