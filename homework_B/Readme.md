# Program Description
As part of the Operating Systems class, more specifically in the topic of Race Conditions and Concurrency, we were challenged to solve the Reader Writer. 

# Diagram
I sketched up a simple diagram to explain what happens when there are multiple readers and one writer trying to access a shared resource and how we can solve this problem using semaphores.
